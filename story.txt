In the forest there lived a witch named Octavia. She was black, and tall. Wore white, hair in braids, and gold jewelry. 
She ran an inn that only took wary travelers in need. The inn on the outside looked as if it was for one person, but the inside could 
change and grow in size. Each room would change to the occupants needs, to make them feel at home. Outside was a garden where she
grew many herbs for spells.
